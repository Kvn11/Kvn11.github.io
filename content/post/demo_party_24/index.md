## Challenge

The LayerOne Demo Board is a 16-bit PIC24F chip with 96K RAM, 256K Flash/ROM.
The goal is to output audio and video that pushes the limits of what is possible with such a limited device.
You can see more details at the [official site](https://www.layerone.org/events/demo-party/), but the main categories are:
- LayerOne Demo Board: Create a fantastic audio/video experience using a LayerOne Demo Board!
- ANSI: Create an awesome 80Ã—23 ANSI art image using the standard 16 colors!
- Wildcard: Anything goes! Props given for creative use of hardware or software!

## Construction

The construction of the board is straightforward, just follow the diagram included with the kit.
For the soldering, I found it easier to just use soldering paste opposed to wire.
It melted faster, and looked cleaner.
