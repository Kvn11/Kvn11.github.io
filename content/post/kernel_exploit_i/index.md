## Vulnerability

The vulnerability to exploit today is: [CVE-2022-27666](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27666).
I just randomly picked this one out from the [Google Recipes Notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9uUAISBzw3ur1aLQqKc5JOQLaJYiOP5pe_B4xCT1KA/edit#heading=h.9c6s9d5wfjju).
There a few PoC's for this vulnerability online, which is good because if I get stuck at some point, I can take a look, but the goal is to develop an exploit all on my own.
The advisory says:
> A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in `net/ipv4/esp4.c` and `net/ipv6/esp6.c`.
> This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat.
