# Setup

Link to the original vulnerability report can be found [here](https://github.com/google/security-research/blob/master/pocs/linux/kernelctf/CVE-2024-0193_cos/metadata.json).a


## Setting up environment

To get up and running as quick as possible, setup your environment as follows:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
python3 python3-pip python3-venv \
bc binutils bison dwarves flex gcc git gnupg2 gzip libelf-dev libncurses5-dev libssl-dev make openssl dwarves perl-base rsync tar xz-utils \
libguestfs-tools \
tmux \
gdb \
qemu qemu-kvm bridge-utils
```

Then download the most recent affected [version](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/releases/tag/v6.7-rc8):

## Building

Make a default config with:

```bash
make defconfig
```

and then `nf_tables` support with:

```
CONFIG_NETFILTER=y
CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y
```

I also have a working config [here](https://github.com/kvn11) (will add soon once post is finished).

Then build the kernel with:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

Then we also need to setup directories for `libguestfs` to work properly.

```bash
make modules
make modules_install
```

Then

```bash
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /lib/modules/6.7.0-rc8/vmlinuz
sudo chmod +r /lib/modules/6.7.0-rc8/vmlinuz
```

Then run this script:

```bash
virt-customize -a ubuntu-24.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img \
       --root-password password:root \
       --ssh-inject pwn:file:/home/jp3g/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
       --run-command 'useradd -m -s /bin/bash pwn' \
       --password pwn:password:abc123 \
       --ssh-inject root:file:/home/jp3g/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This will create an unprivileged user as well as set passwords.


## GDB and QEMU

In order to connect GDB to this container, run the following command:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 3.5G -nographic -no-reboot \
	-enable-kvm -cpu host -smp cores=2 \
	-kernel bzImage \
	-drive file=./ubuntu-24.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img \
	-nic user,model=virtio-net-pci \
	-nographic \
	-append "root=/dev/sda1 rw console=ttyS0"
```

Then run gdb:

```bash
gdb
(gdb) remote target localhost:1234
```

## Getting load address

Next, we have load the symbols from `vmlinux` into gdb at the correct address.
After you have gotten a shell in qemu as root, run:

```bash
cat /proc/kallsyms | grep strncpy_from_user
```

This will give you the address of the `strncpy_from_user` function.
You can of course use any function, but this is the one I chose for my example.
You will see the address at which the function is loaded.
Next, back in your host, run `nm vmlinux | grep strncpy_from_user` to get the address at which the function is located within the binary.
Find the difference between the two addresses, then use that value to subtract from the qemu function address, and that should get you base load address.

# Background Info

## SMEP/SMAP

## Netfilter

Netfilter represents a set of hooks inside the linux kernel, allowing different kernel modules to set callback functions within the kernel's networking stack.
These hooks and callbacks become the filtering and modifications that become applied to the traffic.

## NF_Tables

## User namespaces

## CAP_NET_ADMIN

This is part of something called a linux `capability`.
`Capabilities` are part of a very granular access control system that breaks down the privileges available to the superuser `root` into units that be enabled / disabled for processes.
