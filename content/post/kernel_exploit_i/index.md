## Vulnerability

The vulnerability to exploit today is: [CVE-2022-27666](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27666).
I just randomly picked this one out from the [Google Recipes Notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9uUAISBzw3ur1aLQqKc5JOQLaJYiOP5pe_B4xCT1KA/edit#heading=h.9c6s9d5wfjju).
There a few PoC's for this vulnerability online, which is good because if I get stuck at some point, I can take a look, but the goal is to develop an exploit all on my own.
The advisory says:

> A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in `net/ipv4/esp4.c` and `net/ipv6/esp6.c`.
> This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat.

The vuln appears in the function `int esp_output_head(struct xfrm_state *x, struct sk_buff *skb, struct esp_info *esp)`.
`ESP_SKB_FRAG_MAXSIZE` is defined as `(PAGE_SIZE << SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER)`.

The commit that is linked in the advisory adds a fix to check whether the len of the `skb->data_len + taillen` is greater than `(PAGE_SIZE << SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER)`.
So its likely that `skb->data` might be where our payload will reside.
