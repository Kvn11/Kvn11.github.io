## Vulnerability

The vulnerability to exploit today is: [CVE-2022-27666](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27666).
I just randomly picked this one out from the [Google Recipes Notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9uUAISBzw3ur1aLQqKc5JOQLaJYiOP5pe_B4xCT1KA/edit#heading=h.9c6s9d5wfjju).
There a few PoC's for this vulnerability online, which is good because if I get stuck at some point, I can take a look, but the goal is to develop an exploit all on my own.
The advisory says:

> A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in `net/ipv4/esp4.c` and `net/ipv6/esp6.c`.
> This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat.

The vuln appears in the function `int esp_output_head(struct xfrm_state *x, struct sk_buff *skb, struct esp_info *esp)`.
`ESP_SKB_FRAG_MAXSIZE` is defined as `(PAGE_SIZE << SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER)`.

The commit that is linked in the advisory adds a fix to check whether the len of the `skb->data_len + taillen` is greater than `(PAGE_SIZE << SKB_FRAG_PAGE_ORDER)`.

`skb` is a struct representing a socket buffer, and the payload will likely reside in the data buffer within the `skb` struct.
You can find its definition in `/include/linux/skbuff.h`
The next step is to find the references to this vulnerable function, and basically trace my way up to see how to trigger it.
The next reference to it is in `esp_output` within the same file, however `esp_output` doesn't seem to be called anywhere which is a bit strange.
Also, the function is passed to `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`, so it should be accessible from other modules.
This makes it somewhat difficult now, because I still haven't figure out how to trigger the vulnerability.
However, searching for `esp_output` results in finding `/Documentation/crypto/architecture.rst`, which explains how this code is used, which is a big win.
According to google:

> IPsec is a group of protocols for securing connections between devices.
> It is used to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network.

It basically encrypts IP packets and authenticating the source where the packets come from.
An example would be VPN's.

The IPSEC layer invokes `esp_output` which then triggers the vulnerability, so this actually becomes incredibly simple to trigger once we know how to get the IPSEC layer to invoke the `esp_output`.
This part of IPSEC is the `Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)` which encrypts the payload.
Based on this we can assume that we don't need to setup anything external for this vulnerability, we just need to prepare an IP packet to be sent out.


## Environment Setup

I recommend you use an Ubuntu VM for this, I had issues developing on Kali.
We can start by setting up github.
After you download the linux repo, switch to the vulnerable version / tag with:

```
git checkout -b CVE-2022-2766 v5.16
```
This will create a branch named `CVE-2022-2766` which will contain all the content within the `v5.16` commit, which is the last vulnerable version.

Then `cd linux/` and create a default config file with `make defconfig`.
